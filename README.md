# 📧 Spam E-mail Detector (PyTorch + Google Colab)

A deep learning-based spam email classifier built using Python, PyTorch, and trained in Google Colab.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to classify emails as spam or not spam using natural language processing and a neural network built with PyTorch.

## 🛠️ Features
- Preprocessing of email text (tokenization, cleaning)
- Model built with PyTorch (LSTM-based or FCNN)
- Training and evaluation in Google Colab
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score metrics
- Visualization of results
